# backend-phonebook
The goal is to create an app for saving contacts.


üåê [Phonebook app live](https://phonebook-frontend-sfiq.onrender.com/)
<h3>Goals</h3>
<p>This is a fullstack app written with the use of modern web stack. The goal is simple: allow the user to save the name and phone number of a contact and allow them to search for specific person by name.</p>
<p>This is a project that allowed me to get strong understanding on how the frontend and backend talk to each other, and how further the database is added to the mix.</p>
<p>Moreover, it was the first application that I fully deployed. Initially, I used the fly.io service and later moved to render.com. The backend and frontend are deployed separately.</p>
